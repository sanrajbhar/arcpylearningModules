# Learning Arcpy with Python: Step-by-Step Explanation

## Introduction

Python is a powerful tool for GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professionals, and **ArcPy** is a Python library that allows you to automate mapping and spatial analysis in ArcGIS.

This guide helps you understand ArcPy through simple, practical examples.

## Module 1: Getting Started with ArcPy

### What is ArcPy?

ArcPy is a Python module that allows you to interact with ArcGIS software. It helps you perform tasks like:

- Automating map operations
- Managing GIS data
- Running geoprocessing tools

### Setting Up Your Environment

To use ArcPy, you need:
- ArcGIS installed on your computer.
- Python (included with ArcGIS).
- A script editor like **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.

### Basic Script: Listing Feature Classes

```python
import arcpy  # This imports the ArcPy module so we can use its functions.

arcpy.env.workspace = "C:/GISData"  # Set the workspace (folder) where GIS data is stored.

feature_classes = arcpy.ListFeatureClasses()  # Get a list of all feature classes (GIS layers) in the workspace.

print("Feature Classes:", feature_classes)  # Print the list of feature classes.
